Sure! Here's how you can integrate the dependencies section with details into your README file:

## Usage with IntelliJ IDEA
### Adding JavaFX Dependency
 #### Open IntelliJ IDEA: 
Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open your project.

#### Access Project Structure: 
Click on the "File" menu, then select "Project Structure" (or press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S).

#### Add JavaFX SDK: 
In the Project Structure dialog, select "Modules" under the Project Settings section. Then, select your module and navigate to the "Dependencies" tab.

#### Add Dependency: 
Click on the "+" icon, then select "JARs or directories". Navigate to the directory where your JavaFX SDK is located and select the appropriate JAR files (e.g., javafx-controls.jar, javafx-base.jar, etc.).

#### Apply Changes: 
Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes and close the Project Structure dialog.
## Dependencies
- JavaFX: JavaFX is a set of Java graphics libraries for creating rich desktop applications. To integrate JavaFX into your project, you can include the necessary libraries either manually or through a build automation tool such as Maven or Gradle. Here is an example dependency declaration for Maven:
```
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
      <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
      <version>17.0.6</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
      <artifactId>javafx-fxml</artifactId>
      <version>17.0.6</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
      <artifactId>javafx-web</artifactId>
      <version>17.0.6</version>
    </dependency>
```

- MySQL Connector: The MySQL Connector for Java allows Java programs to connect to MySQL databases using standard Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) APIs. To include the MySQL Connector in your project, you can add the dependency through your build automation tool. Here is an example dependency declaration for
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.27</version>
</dependency>

```
